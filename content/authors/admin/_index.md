I am an evolutionary ecologist applying population genomics tools and techniques to understand how populations are changing through both space and time, with emphasis on how we as humans are driving such processes around the globe. I am particularly interested in questions of adaptation and selection.

When not doing my own research, I am also very passionate about getting our younger generations engaged in scientific endeavors. In the past, I spent several years working in the Philadelphia Public School District supplementing science curriculum with hands-on activities, and running science summer camps for all age groups. I also served as the Outreach Coordinator for the Ecology & Evolution GSA at Rutgers, and as an Ecology Teacher at an early education enrichment center in NJ.
